# Playdate Lua resources

The official SDK provides a lot of what you might need to build a simple game, but there are a few third-party tools and templates worth mentioning.

- My [Ren's Adventures](https://github.com/Alanaktion/rens-adventures) project, an example project to build off of and modify that implements a basic visual novel framework on the Noble Engine. Uses Lua tables to organize the script, and handles character sprites, text display, save states, BGM, CGs, etc. Also includes:
  - My new variants of the Pedallica 14px front from the SDK, with new glyphs and a bold version
  - A simple SaveData utility that could be adapted to work with lots of game types
- [Noble Engine](https://noblerobot.github.io/NobleEngine/index.html) - a simple (but currently incomplete and a bit buggy) "engine", mostly useful for its scene transition and menu UI.
- [Panels](https://github.com/cadin/panels) - A powerful framework for making interactive comics on Playdate
